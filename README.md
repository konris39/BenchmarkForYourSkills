Hello,
This is my simple benchmark, to test your personal skills as:

-aim
-> click "Play" to test how good your "aim" is, or "CPS" how fast can you click!

Thats how "aim" test looks like :DD

And that is how "CPS" looks like :DD

UI is very simplistic!
You can set difficulty (the time between each respawn of the target!)
